### Requirements

- Node.js >= 12.22.0
- pnpm 7

### Directory Structure

- [`.github`](.github) — GitHub configuration including the CI workflow.<br>
- [`.husky`](.husky) — Husky configuration and hooks.<br>
- [`public`](./public) — Static assets such as robots.txt, images, and favicon.<br>
- [`src`](./src) — Application source code, including pages, components, styles.

### Scripts

- `yarn dev` — Starts the application in development mode at `http://localhost:3000`.
- `yarn build` — Creates an optimized production build of your application.
- `yarn start` — Starts the application in production mode.
- `yarn type-check` — Validate code using TypeScript compiler.
- `yarn lint` — Runs ESLint for all files in the `src` directory.
- `yarn format` — Runs Prettier for all files in the `src` directory.

### Path Mapping

TypeScript are pre-configured with custom path mappings. To import components or files, use the `@` prefix.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/Button';

// To import images or other files from the public folder
import avatar from '@/public/avatar.png';
```

### Switch to Yarn/npm

This project uses yarn by default, but this choice is yours. If you'd like to switch to pnpm/npm, install the dependencies with yarn/npm, change the CI workflow, and Husky Git hooks to use yarn/npm commands.
